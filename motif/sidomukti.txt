Sidomukti
The name "Sidomukti" is taken from two Javanese words, namely "sido" which means to be or become, and "mukti" which means happiness or sufficiency. The Sidomukti motif is interpreted as hoping its wearers will get happiness and goodness in life. Many variations of Sidomukti batik motifs are popularly sold in the market, including the "Sidomukti Kupu-kupu" batik. It is said that the distinctive "kupu-kupu" (butterfly) ornament on each batik cloth symbolizes perfection and teaches people to remain patient through a sometimes-painful process to achieve happiness in life.Source:
