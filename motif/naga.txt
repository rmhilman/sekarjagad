Naga
Naga (dragons) are often depicted as surrounded by water or clouds. This creature is glorified because it is believed to have extraordinary powers. It can fly, it can also live on the seabed, and some live on the ground. Dragon is considered as a protector, fortune giver, and fertility symbol. Mythically speaking, it pours rain when in a mood; even if it is angry, it still blesses dry season and brings hopes to life amid stormy sea.Source:
