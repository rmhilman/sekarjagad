Banji
The banji motif is a stylization of the Indian swastika motif that enters Indonesia through China. The name “banji” comes from the Chinese word “banzi”, which literally means “ten thousand”, and the swastika itself is a spiritual symbol adapted by the Chinese. “Banji” symbolizes abundance and the spiritual connection of everything in the Universe. The motif is meant to maintain one’s spiritual purity and protect one from dangers.Source:
