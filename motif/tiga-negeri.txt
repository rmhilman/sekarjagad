Tiga Negeri
It is the typical batik from Lasem, which is located on the northern coast of Java. Tiga Negeri means three regions as this batik is influenced by motives from Dutch, Javanese and Chinese. From the motif perspective, Batik Tiga Negeri has a distinctive complexity because it combines inland batik motifs (Solo and Yogyakarta) with coastal motifs (Pekalongan and Cirebon). The motifs depict animals, plants, flowers, butterflies, and the colors are very vibrant. Interestingly, its color composition is also the result of acculturation from those three cultures: red (inspired by Chinese), indigo blue (typical Dutch), and soga brown (characteristic Javanese).
