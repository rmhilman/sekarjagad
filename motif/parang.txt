Parang
Parang batik has a high meaning and a high philosophical value. This batik motif is one of the oldest basic batik motifs in Indonesia. Parang symbolically stands for some advice to never give up, like ocean waves that never stop moving. Batik Parang also depicts a relationship that never breaks, both in terms of efforts to improve oneself, efforts to fight for prosperity, as well as forms of family ties.Source:
