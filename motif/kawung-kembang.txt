Kawung
The kawung motif means perfection, purity, and holiness. In relation to the word suwung which means empty, the kawung motif symbolizes the emptiness of worldly passions and desires, resulting in perfect self-control. This emptiness makes a person neutral, impartial, not wanting to stand out, following the flow of life, letting everything around him run according to the will of nature. Semar, the incarnation of a god who has a very good and wise character, always wears this kawung motif.
