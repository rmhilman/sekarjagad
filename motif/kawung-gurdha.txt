Kawung
The kawung motif means perfection, purity, and holiness. In relation to the word suwung which means empty, the kawung motif symbolizes the emptiness of worldly passions and desires, resulting in perfect self-control. This emptiness makes a person neutral, impartial, not wanting to stand out, following the flow of life, letting everything around him run according to the will of nature. Semar, the incarnation of a god who has a very good and wise character, always wears this kawung motif.


Kawung Gurdha
Gurdha symbolizes service to the disadvantage people. Rice flowers represent the nature that is always blessed by light rain. The risen motif Udan Liris itself means light rain. Kawung surrounds Gurdha as a sign of closeness in working with those people who are always guarded by the spirit of Gurdha. Gurdha is Garuda, the Javanese Eagle with sharp eyes and a strong spirit to face the challenges of nature.Source:
