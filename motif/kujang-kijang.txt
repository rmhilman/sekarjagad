Kujang Kijang
Among other West Java batik motif, Kujang Kijang motif is the one from Bogor. The Kujang Kijang motif is inspired by the kujang which is a typical weapon of the Sundanese tribe and the kijang which is the favorite animal of the Bogor people. The Kujang Kijang motif also has its own philosophical meaning, namely the pointed tip of the kujang and the outward-facing kijang horns that illustrate security and provide protection from all directions.Source:
