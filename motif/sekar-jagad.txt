Sekar Jagad
Sekar Jagad is a traditional batik motif with deep philosophical values. It is important to know that Sekar Jagad is taken from the word "kaart" which in Dutch means map, and "jagad" which means world in Javanese. When combined, the philosophy behind the Sekar Jagad motif is not just a world map, but rather depicting the beauty of diversity in Indonesia. It is fascinating to capture multifaceted social dynamics on a layer of fabric. Source:
