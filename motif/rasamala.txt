Rasamala
The rasamala batik motif is associated with the time the Dutch first entered the Sunda Kelapa region in the 16th Century. At that time, Sunda Kelapa was a wild swamp forest region covered with rasamala trees. The Betawi people (local inhabitants of this region) consider the rasamala as a sacred tree for its fragrant odor.Source:
