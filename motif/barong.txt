Barong
The Barong refers to the mythological animal with supra-natural power. This Barong creature is a combination between the lion or the tiger (body, legs, eyes), eagle, elephant, and dragon (grinning mouth with a long tongue), which is frequently found in many Javanese and Balinese arts. This motif represents power and masculinity. It also signifies a philosophy that human being has two sides of characters. One needs to tame its wicked desires and temptations in order to fully develop as mature and wise human being.Source:
